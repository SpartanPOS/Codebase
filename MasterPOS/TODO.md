#non-exhaustive list of tasks

Implement workers:
* They will need to:
- [ ]handle and store JWT tokens
- [ ]authenticate with auth0
        
- [ ]store cacheable features onto the device so it is a PWA

Cleanup code:
    * code is messy and doesnt follow any code standards
    - [x] use ESLINT for this?

Finish implementing modules.
    will need to dynamically import modules using full path instead of just their name

* Add more tasks to TODO list:
    * self explanatory

Runtime Immutable:
    make an immutable runtime class constructed based on the items in the runtime folder
    check the build every once in a while and use timestamp authority to sign the runtime

Runtime items:
